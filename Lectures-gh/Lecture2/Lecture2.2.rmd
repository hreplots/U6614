# Introduction to R Markdown

Throughout this course and beyond, you'll be using R Markdown to write-up your work. An R Markdown document is just a text file with the .rmd extension. R Markdown is a _markup syntax_ that you can use within R Studio to generate documents (html, pdf, Word docs) that allows you to easily embed R code and output along with additional write-up.

R Markdown files consist of the following:

1. The YAML header (required)
1. The body of your document, including: 
    + Text and section headers 
    + R Code chunks

The process of generating a document from an .rmd file using RStudio is called **knitting.** In other words, you don't simply run R code, you knit your .rmd file in R Markdown. You can do this by clicking on ![](knitbutton.png) at the top of the RStudio interface or by using the keyboard shortcut **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + k**. This process will also run any R code you have inside your .rmd file.


# The YAML header 

The YAML header is code at the top of your R Markdown file that controls the look and feel of your document. At a minimum, your R Markdown file must contain the following YAML header located in between two sets of - - - :

```{r eval = FALSE}
---
title: "Your document title"
author: "SIPA U6614"
output:
  html_document: default
---
```

The title and author, and any other fields you specify (e.g. date, subtitle) will display at the top of your document.

Also make sure that the `html_document: default` line is indented at least two spaces or you'll run into an error. Each level requires another two spaces of indentation to execute properly.

Note: apparently YAML stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language", which I think is an attempt at recursive programming "humor"... if you think humor is the appropriate word `r emo::ji("upside_down_face")`.


# Section headings & table of contents

You can add section headings to your document by using one or more hashtags at the beginning of a line of code. Adding hashtags moves the text down one heading level (e.g. `##` specified a second level heading.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Heading level 1

Blah.

## Heading level 2

Blah blah.

### Heading level 3

Blah blah blah.
```

You can also specify options in the YAML header that display a table of contents based on the section headings you use (by adding `toc: TRUE` to the YAML header). There are different options you can play around with in the YAML header to change the formatting of the table of contents.

```{r eval = FALSE}
---
title: "Your document title"
author: "SIPA U6614"
output:
  html_document: default
    toc: TRUE
    toc_depth: 3
    toc_float: TRUE
    number_sections: FALSE
---
```


# Text formatting

You can freely enter text anywhere below the YAML header, and rely on R Markdown's built in options for text formatting. Some commonly used formatting syntax:

- *Italics*: wrap text in asterisks `*like this*`
- **Bold**: wrap text in double asterisks `**like this**`
- Hyperlinks: create [hyperlinked](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) text by using the syntax `[R Markdown website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)`
- Bulleted lists like this one: start each item in your list with an asterisk followed by a space, indenting as appropriate:
```{r eval = FALSE}
* list item 1
* list item 2
```
Consult the [R Markdown reference guide](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf?_ga=2.36341096.936527741.1595035327-1635033536.1592156702) for more formatting syntax.


# R code chunks 

## Embedded code chunks

R Markdown documents allow you to embed **chunks** of R code and output into your document, so the reader can see your results and how they were generated. Here is the basic syntax for a code chunk.

<pre class="output_example">```{r} 
# do something
(100 * 2) / 10 
```</pre>

Without any options specified, your document will show the code from inside the code chunk followed by any corresponding output.
```{r}
# do something
(100 * 2) / 10 
```

The handy keyboard shortcut to insert a code chunk is **Ctrl+Alt+I** or	**Cmd+Option+I** for Windows and Macs, respectively.

There are a number of options you can use to specify the handling of each code chunk. Here is a code chunk with `echo = FALSE` so the code chunk will run but only the output will show up in your knitted documented.

<pre class="output_example">```{r echo = FALSE} 
# nevermind
```</pre>

`include = FALSE` is another common code chunk option that executes the code chunk but suppresses both the code and output. 


## Document wide code chunk options

You can also specify code chunk options that apply to the entire document. It's often a good idea to use the following document-wide code chunk to hide warnings and messages that might show up in the console after running R code, but don't belong in your document. 

<pre class="output_example">```{r include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```</pre>

## In-line code chunks

Code results can be inserted directly into the text of a .Rmd file by enclosing the code with `r` (backticks). You can use this syntax to refer to objects in R.

It's particularly useful syntax for referring to stored calculations, rather than hard-coding the values in your write-up. Let's suppose we want to make a calculation based on the Gapminder data frame (after loading the Gapminder library).

```{r warning = FALSE}
library(gapminder)
gm_india <- subset(gapminder, country == "India")
mean(gm_india$lifeExp)
```
You could reference this calculation explicitly in your text write-up.

<pre class = "output_example">
The mean life expectancy for India over this period was 53.17.
</pre>

A better way to do this is to point to the object in R that contains the mean using an in-line code reference to the mean.

<pre class = "output_example">
The mean life expectancy for India over this period was `r knitr::inline_expr('mean(gm_india$lifeExp)')`.
</pre>

This approach will generate the following output in your knitted document.

<pre class = "output_out">
The mean life expectancy for India over this period was `r mean(gm_india$lifeExp)`.
</pre>

Even better, let's use the `round()` function to improve the display format.

<pre class = "output_example">
The mean life expectancy for India over this period was `r knitr::inline_expr('round(mean(gm_india$lifeExp), 1)')`.
</pre>

<pre class = "output_out">
The mean life expectancy for India over this period was `r round(mean(gm_india$lifeExp),1)`.
</pre>


# Workflow, tips and troubleshooting


## Workflow

1. Set up a clear file structure and stick to it. For example, create a Class folder, and then an Assignments folder within Class, and an Assignment 1 folder within Assignment (U6614/Assignments/Assignment 1). 

2. Open a new R Markdown file. Specify the settings you want in the YAML header

3. Save the R Markdown file in the appropriate folder. Make sure any other files you point to (e.g. data, images) are also stored in the same folder.


## Tips and troubleshooting

* For the purposes of this class, all submissions should be submitted as pdf documents "knit" from an R Markdown file. 

* Treat R Markdown as its own system object environment from the R console. If you refer to an object in a code chunk you first need to create it in R Markdown, an object created in the R Console won't be recognized by your R Markdown document.

* Remember you only have to `install.packages()` once but you do have to load a package before using it with the `library()` function. You should never include `install.packages()` in your R Markdown script, but you should always load the libraries you need at the beginning of your script. Failing to load the correct libraries is a common source of errors.

* Make sure any files you use are located in your working directory, which should be the same folder as your .rmd file.

* Try knitting early and often. Don't wait until the end, or you're likely to have numerous errors to sort through. Knitting/running code piecewise as you go is a good way to identify errors and coding mistakes before things get too complicated.

* Use section headers and comments to structure your write-up according to assignment questions or other document structure you want to create.
