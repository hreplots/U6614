## POLICY QUESTION FOR THE NEXT 3 CLASSES:
## Police can stop and ticket or arrest people for subway fare evasion. 
## Is there racial bias in their subway fare evasion enforcement in Brooklyn? 

## Week 3: What can we learn from microdata?
##  - Which demographic groups experience the most enforcement?
##  - Where is the NYPD making the most subway fare evasion arrests?

## Please consult the 2-page data primer before continuing
## https://hreplots.github.io/U6614/Lectures-gh/Lecture3-gh/lecture_3-6_data_primer.pdf


## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. load libraries and check working directory
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#install.packages("fastDummies")
library(fastDummies)
library(tidyverse)
#library(forcats) #included with Tidyverse


#also confirm correct working directory
getwd()


## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. Load, inspect and describe the two public defender client datasets 
##
##  a. load datasets using read_csv() and inspect
##
##    two datasets of administrative records from public defenders in Brooklyn
##      1. microdata_BDS_inclass.csv: Brooklyn Defender Services
##      2. microdata_LAS_inclass.csv: Legal Aid Society
##
##    each row contains client data for an individual arrested for subway fare evasion
##
##    note these files were provided by the respective orgs with no documentation
##
##  b. give a brief overview of the data 
##     (start to think about this now, but revisit after you know what
##      information proved most relevant for your analysis)
##
##  c. what is the unit of observation? what population does this `sample` represent?
##     do you think this sample does a good job representing the population of interest?
##
##  d. inspect and describe the coding of race/ethnicity information in each dataset
##
##  e. are there any data limitations you think are important to note from the outset? 
##     - note that messy data isn't a limitation, it just means we have work to do.
##     - limitations might include information that is missing in this data/sample

    str(arrests_bds, give.attr = FALSE) 
    str(arrests_las, give.attr = FALSE)
    # note the give.attr argument to make long str() output more readable

    summary(arrests_las)
  
  # let's convert race and ethnicity to factors to inspect before cleaning
    arrests_bds <- arrests_bds %>% 
      mutate(race = as.factor(race), 
             ethnicity = as.factor(ethnicity))
    
    arrests_las <- arrests_las %>% 
      mutate(race = as.factor(las_race_key), 
             ethnicity = as.factor(hispanic_flag))

  # compare Hispanic/ethnicity coding
    summary(arrests_bds$ethnicity)
    summary(arrests_las$ethnicity)


#2d.
  


## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 3. clean BDS race and ethnicity data: 
##
##  recode race and ethnicity vars and assign to new df called arrests_bds.clean
##  generate 3 new columns for cleaned data:
##    a. race_clean
##    b. ethnicity_clean
##    c. create a single factor variable w/mutually exclusive groups (race_eth)
##       - Black, Non-Hispanic White, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, Other, NA
##    
##  before we do this...
##    
##  in-class discussion questions: 
##  - what cat do you want to use for Black Hispanic identity?
##  - what is missing by using mutually exclusive, single identity categories?

##      - Make sure you end up with a data frame with the following var names
##        and identical coding as in arrests_bds_clean:
##        - race_eth, age, male, dismissal (not in the BDS data), st_id, loc2

## 5. Append BDS and LAS microdata -- stack rows with bind_rows()
##
##    a. create a column (pd) to identify PD data source ("las" or "bds")
##
##    b. Append arrests_bds.clean and arrests_las.clean
##        - use bind_rows from the dplyr package
##        - store combined data as new data frame called arrests.clean
##        - only keep columns for pd, race_eth, age, male, dismissal, st_id, loc2,
##          converting to factors for columns w/categorical data as needed
##        - note that dismissal column is in LAS data but not BDS
##        - inspect race_eth for accuracy/consistency
##        - store as new data frame arrests.clean
##
##    c. use the nrow function to display the total number of arrests
##
##    d. Save arrests.clean df as an .RData file in a new Lecture4 folder for next week
##
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5a.
  arrests_bds.clean <- arrests_bds.clean %>% mutate(pd = "bds")
  arrests_las.clean <- arrests_las.clean %>% mutate(pd = "las")
  
# 5b. we don't have arrests_las.clean yet, 
#     so for now let's append arrests_bds.clean to itself
  arrests.clean <- bind_rows(arrests_bds.clean, 
                             arrests_las.clean) %>%
    mutate(pd = as.factor(pd),
           st_id = as.factor(st_id), # original station/location info is not continuous
           loc2 = as.factor(loc2)) %>% 
    select(pd, race_eth, age, male, st_id, loc2, dismissal) 
      # note that we added dismissal column from the LAS data (wasn't in BDS)
  
  summary(arrests.clean)


# 5c. 
  # use nrow to get number of observations as an in-line code reference
    nrow(arrests.clean)
  
# 5d.
  save(LIST DATA OBJECTS TO SAVE HERE SEPARATED BY COMMAS,
       file = "arrests.clean.RData")  

  # for future reference, can also write to a csv file:
  # write_csv(arrests_all, "arrests_all.csv") 

  
  
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 6. Descriptive statistics by race_eth (grouping)
##
##    a. group arrests.clean by race_eth,
##       show arrest counts for each race_eth category using tidyverse functions
##        Note: we already obtained this information using the summary command,
##        but sometimes it's useful to store this information to work with
##
##    b. show a table with the proportion of total arrests in each race_eth category
##        - how does excluding NAs change the results? 
##
##    c. compute avg age, share male, and dismissal rate for each race_eth group, 
##       along with the total sample size. 
##       also compute the sample size for the dismissal variabe as well
##        (just the number of non-NA observations for dimissal)
##        - assign results to a new object, race_eth_stats
##        - HINT: similar to (a) above, but specify different stats in summarise()
##        - HINT: for most of these stats you need to tell R to ignore NA values
##
##    d. what, if anything, do you think is interesting to note about the
##       distribution of:
##        - age by race (conditional distribution of age)
##        - male share by race
##        - dismissal by race
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 6a. 
  arrests.clean %>% count(race_eth, sort = TRUE)

## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 7. grouping by subway station, with subway-station level statistics.
##      our data includes the following columns
##        - st_id: unique subway station identifier
##        - loc2: subway station name (recognized by google maps)
##      for the remainder of this Assignment, group by loc2
##   
##    a. use dummy_cols() in the fastDummies package to create dummies for each race_eth cat
##       and show the mean for each category
##
##    b. using group_by(), create a new data frame w/station-level observations,
##       call it arrests_stations and including the following information:
##      - station name (given by loc2)
##      - st_id
##      - total number of arrests at each station
##      - total number of arrests for each race_eth category at each station
##      - sort in descending order of total number of arrests
##      - only show the top 10 stations 
##
##    c. create a new data frame called arrests_stations_top with the following information
##      - the combined total number of Black and Hispanic arrests (call it n_bh)
##      - the number of arrests with race/ethnicity coded as NA
##      - sh_bh = share of arrests that are Black and Hispanic (excluding race_eth = NA from denominator)
##      - sort in ascending order of Black and Hispanic arrest share
##      - only show for stations with at least 50 total arrests
##      - use kable() in the knitr package for better formatting
##        - HINT: save as a data frame and pass as an argument to knitr::kable()
##
##    d. briefly summarize any interesting findings about the distribution of race across stations
##      - hint: are there any high arrest stations w/a high share of NHW arrests?
