## Is NYPD enforcement of subway fare evasion enforcement in Brooklyn racist?

## 1. load and inspect datasets
##
##    two datasets of administrative records from public defenders in Brooklyn
##      1. microdata_BDS_inclass.csv: Brooklyn Defender Services
##      2. microdata_LAS_inclass.csv: Legal Aid Society
##    each row is client data for an individual arrested for subway fare evasion
##    public defenders represent nearly everybody arrested for subway fare evasion
##    these files were provided by the respective orgs with no documentation
##
##  a. what is the unit of observation and representative population?
##  b. inspect and describe the coding of race/ethnicity information in each dataset?

## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 3. BDS: create a single race_eth factor variable w/mutually exclusive categories:
##       - Black, Non-Hispanic White, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, Other, NA
##    Before you do this...
##    
##    In-class discussion questions: 
##      what cat do you want to use for Black Hispanic identity?
##      what is missing by using mutually exclusive categories?
##      was race coded by NYPD or client w/public defender input? we don't really know!
##    
##    a. Can you think of a better way to incorporate race into analysis of biased enforcement?
##    b. Create race_eth
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Save arrests_bds.clean to use in Lecture 5
# saveRDS(arrests_bds.clean, "../Lecture5/arrests_bds.clean.rds")
    
# 3a. let's investigate a bit
  # here is a quick and easy way to show crosstabs using base R
  table(arrests_bds.clean$race_clean, arrests_bds.clean$hispanic, useNA = "always")
  prop.table(table(arrests_bds.clean$race_clean, arrests_bds.clean$hispanic), 2)  %>% round(2)
  str(arrests_bds.clean)

    mutate(race_clean_char = as.character(race_clean)) %>%

  str(arrests_bds.clean)  
  table(arrests_bds.clean$race_eth, arrests_bds.clean$hispanic, useNA = "always")
  
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 4 a. Repeat 3 creating race_eth in the Legal Aid data (arrests_las) with the same coding
##      HINT: note that Hispanic identity is included in both las_race_key & hispanic_flag
##   b. Make sure you end up with a data frame with the following variable names,
##      and identical coding as inarrests_bds_clean:
##    - race_eth, age, male, dismissal (not in the BDS data), st_id, loc2
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

str(arrests_las)

arrests_las.clean <- arrests_las %>% 
  mutate(race_eth = recode(las_race_key, "Asian or Pacific Islander" = "Asian/Pacific Islander",
                                         "Unknown" = "NA",

table(arrests_las.clean$race_eth, arrests_las.clean$hispanic_flag, useNA = "always")

    
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 5. appending: stacking rows with rbind
##    a. create a field (pd) to identify the public defender data source (= "las" or "bds")
##    b. Append arrests_bds.clean and arrests_las.clean
##    c. use the nrow function to display the total number of arrests
##    d. inspect race_eth for accuracy/consistency, export new df as "arrests_all.csv"
##        (hint: use the write_csv function introduced in Lecture 3.1)
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5a.
arrests_bds.clean <- arrests_bds.clean %>% mutate(pd = "bds")
arrests_las.clean <- arrests_las.clean %>% mutate(pd = "las")

# 5b.
arrests.clean <- plyr::rbind.fill(arrests_las.clean, arrests_bds.clean) %>%
  select(pd, race_eth, age, male, dismissal, st_id, loc2)
str(arrests.clean)
summary(arrests.clean)

# 5c. 

# 5d.
write_csv(arrests.clean, "arrests_all.csv") 

## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 6. Grouping by race_eth
##    a. group arrests.clean by race_eth and store as its own df race_eth_counts
##          Note: we already obtained this information using the summary command,
##          but in some cases it might be useful to store this information to work with
##    b. compute average age, share male, and dimissal rate for each race/ethnicity category 
##          (store as race_eth_stats)
##        hint: make sure you tell R to ignore missing elements
##    c. what, if anything, do you think is interesting to note about
##        the distribution of age conditional on race, male given race, and dismissal by race
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 6a. 
race_eth_counts <- arrests.clean %>%
  group_by(race_eth) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
race_eth_counts
str(race_eth_counts)

# equivalent to using the count() function
arrests.clean %>% count(race_eth, sort = TRUE)

# if we want to exclude NAs
arrests.clean %>% 
  filter(!is.na(race_eth)) %>% 
  count(race_eth, sort = TRUE)


# 6b.
race_eth_stats <- arrests.clean %>%
  group_by(race_eth) %>%
  summarize(n = n(), 
            mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_male = mean(male, na.rm = TRUE))
race_eth_stats 

# 6c. 


## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 7. grouping by subway station, with subway-station level statistics.
##      our data includes the following columns
##        - st_id: unique subway station identifier
##        - loc2: subway station name (recognized by google maps)
##   
##    a. let's use fastDummies::dummy_cols to create a dummy variable for each race_eth cat
##       this will come in handy later on.
##
##    b. create a new data frame w/station-level observations (arrests_stations) including the following:
##      - station name (given by loc2)
##      - st_id
##      - total number of arrests at each station
##      - total number of arrests for each race_eth category at each station
##      - share of arrests at each station that are Black and Hispanic
##      - sort in descending order of total number of arrests
##
##    c. show a date table (arrests_stations_top) with station-level observations including the following:
##      - station name,
##      - station arrest total
##      - sh_bh = share of arrests that are Black and Hispanic (excluding race_eth = NA from deonomintor)
##      - sorted in ascending order above Black and Hispanic arrest share
##      - only show for stations with at least 50 total arrests
##
##    d. briefly summarize any interesting findings about the distribution of race across stations
##      - hint: are there any high arrest stations (say, > 50 arrests total) with a high share of NHW arrests?
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. barplots 
##    a. barplot of all arrests by race_eth category (proportions of all arrests, sorted)
