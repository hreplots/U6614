*Before knitting your rmd file as a pdf, you will need to install TinyTex for Latex distribution by running the following code:*

`tinytex::install_tinytex()`

# Load and inspect the two public defender client datasets (BDS & LAS).  


## Give a brief overview of the data. The aim is not be exhaustive, but to paint a picture of they key features of the data with respect to the policy questions you'll be exploring.


## For each dataset, what is the unit of observation and population represented by this "sample"? Do you think this sample does a good job representing the population of interest?


## Inspect and describe the coding of race/ethnicity in each dataset. 


## From the outset, are there any data limitations you think are important to note? 


\medspace

# Clean BDS race and ethnicity data (insert code chunks that only include code you used to recode and very briefly validate your recoding )


## BDS: race data (generate column `race_clean`).


## BDS: ethnicity data (generate column `ethnicity_clean`).


## Generate a single race/ethnicity factor variable `race_eth` with mutually exclusive categories.


\medspace

# Clean LAS race and ethnicity data

## Follow your own steps to end up at a comparably coded `race_eth` variable for the LAS data.

|          *NOTE: you may be able to do everything in a single pipe, depending on your approach
|           (but you certainly don't have to).*

# Combining (appending) the BDS and LAS microdata 

## Create a column (`pd`) to identify public defender data source.

## Append `arrests_bds.clean` and `arrests_las.clean` using `rbind()`. Store as new data frame `arrests_all` and inspect for consistency/accuracy.

## What is the total number of subway fare evasion arrest records?


## Export `arrests_all` as .csv, and save as .rds file.


\medspace

# Descriptive statistics by race/ethnicity

## Print the number of arrests for each race/ethnicity category (a frequency table).


## Print the proportion of total arrests for each race/ethnicity category.


## Show the average age, share male, and dimissal rate for each race/ethnicity category. Describe any noteworthy findings.


\medspace

# Subway-station level analysis

## Create dummy variables for each race/ethnicity category and show summary statistics only for these dummy variables.


## Aggregate to station-level observations and show a table with the top 10 stations by arrest totals, including the following information for each station:
 
  - *station name (loc2)*
  - *station arrest total*
  - *combined total number of Black and Hispanic arrests*
  - *total number of arrests with race/ethnicity coded as NA*
  - *share of arrests that are Black and Hispanic (excluding race_eth = NA from denominator)*
  - *sorted in ascending order above Black and Hispanic arrest share*
  - *remember to only show stations with at least 50 total arrests*
  - *use kable() in the knitr package for better formatting*


##  Aggregate to station-level observations (group by loc2), and show a table of stations with at least 50 arrests along with the following information:

  - *station name (loc2)*
  - *station arrest total*
  - *share of arrests that are Black and Hispanic (excluding race_eth = NA from denominator)*
  - *sorted in ascending order above Black and Hispanic arrest share*
  - *remember to only show stations with at least 50 total arrests*
  - *use kable() in the knitr package for better formatting*


## Briefly summarize any noteworthy findings from the table you just generated.


# (OPTIONAL) Visualize the distribution of arrests by race/ethnicity at stations with > 100 arrests.

|        *Hint: see R code from class, section 8*
